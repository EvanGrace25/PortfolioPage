    <h1>Evan's Learning Progress</h1>
    <p>I have been following the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">"Odin Project"</a> curriculum to help me learn all about web apps and sit in the mind of a web developer. I want to come across all the same issues that they do.</p>
    <p>You will find below, all of my current work with the newest at the top, and the oldest at the bottom. I am currently halfway through the Foundations course and have lots more to go.</p>
